# 99.9-of-Gamblers-Quit-Before-Their-First-Big-Win
I want to gamble in my time because I want to have fun and don't have an addiction, trust me.
# Languages
Python, I guess, because I don't care about how fast it's going to take to run
I also only have python compiler on VS (Not sure if it will have the compiler if I transfer onto VS from GitHub)
# Gambling Stuff
I'm going to make only the games that I know to play or I'll just create a simple version of it:
- Blackjack
- Slots
- Idk what it's called, but I call it bridge
- Some other stuff
